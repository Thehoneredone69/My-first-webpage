<h1> My year end relection 
<p style="color: aliceblue
</h1> A lot of things happened this year. I had a teacher i didnt like so i switched my class. I did like that teacher but the class was way harder. I then went to visit my grandparents to go to a funeral since my grandmother died. When i came back i improved my grades a bit and got two perfect attendance rewards.
